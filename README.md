# Co-WIN2.0-Sensor-Network
The development of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) Network was becoming more universal 
in recent decade, prior to setting up AWS by commercials and individual uses, AWS mainly 
served for meteorological monitoring application by governmental institutes.

Starting from 2007, with the establishment of The Community Weather Information Network 
(Co-WIN) in Hong Kong, more than 150 educational institutions and community organizations 
had joined to install AWS in their own places for promoting education on meteorology and 
environmental science through the Co-WIN platform. With the genuine support of our Co-WIN 
partners, our sensor networks were widely spread across our entire Hong Kong, and quality 
assurance standard-formatted meteorological data have been received in enriching our 
database. 

With the Co-WIN sensor network, Hong Kong Observatory and partner institutes could access 
the database in performing some micro-climate research and investigating the climatology 
in a designated area, which could help in having a better understanding on our living 
environment.

Co-WIN 2.0, 10 years after the establishment of the Co-WIN network, a phase 2 public
education was commenced in promoting meteorology and climate change to public citizens 
with more multi-disciplinary interactions and public engagement, with the promotion of 
STEM education by HKSAR government in 2016, we would like to implicate science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics into a DIY Weather Station project in helping 
students and public parties involve in the designing and assembling processes of a AWS 
and innovate from it.
